            <h2>Advantages</h2>

            <ul class="lists">

                <li>Teams are formed and often co-located, which means team members physically work at the same location.</li>
                <li>Project team members report to the project manager, not to a functional or departmental manager.</li>
                <li>Project managers have high to ultimate authority over the project.</li>
                <li>Loyalties are formed to the project, not to a functional manager.</li>
                <li>Clear line of authority enables team members directly report to the project manager.</li>
                <li>Reduced conflicts and faster decision making.</li>
                <li>Due to a single reporting system, there is strong and effective communication within the project management team.</li>
                <li>Due to a single authority, less time is consumed in communication, and the response to stakeholdersâ€™ concerns is fast.</li>

            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>

            <ul class="lists">

                <li>Project team members might find themselves out of work at the end of the project. An example of this might be a consultant who works on a project until completion and then is put on the bench or let go at the end of the project.</li>
                <li>If you have a situation where you need a highly specialized skill at certain times throughout the project, the resource you're using to perform this function might be idle during other times in the project. Hence managing costs & expectations get difficult.</li>
                <li>Project Manager has too much Authority.</li>
                <li>Functioning is characterized by strict deadlines and tight schedules, which makes the work environment stressful.</li>
